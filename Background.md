International Student Enrollement in Nova Scotia

Public universities in Nova Scotia have become increasingly dependent on international students as one of its main form of revenue. International enrollment have grown at a much faster rate than domestic enrollment. This growth has helped universities manage rising operating costs, support academic programs, and fund different projects for student services (Canada, 2024). Because of this dependence, International student enrollment now play a major role in helping universities cover operating costs and support student services.

The decision matters because the benefits of international enrollment come with risks. International enrollment has placed pressure on housing (Ayers, 2023), the amount of students in a classroom, and student services. In Nova Scotia many students struggle to find affordable housing, which raises the question can Universities survive without enrolling large numbers of international students?

The decision is difficult because it involves tradeoffs. Reducing international enrollment could ease housing and improve student support, but it could also create budget gaps for universities the rely heavily on tuition revenue. Reducing enrollment can lead to department cuts (WIllick, 2025), or increased costs for domestic students. But, maintaining or increasing international enrollment may protect the university finances but it puts pressure on housing. There is also the changes to federal immigration and study permit policies with the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) capping international student permits at 155,000 from 300,000 (Ismail, 2025). This policy increase the risk of universities that are too dependent on International enrollment.

Some keystakeholders who are affected by this decision include the Nova Scotia Minister of Advanced Education who is responsible for overseeing public universities. Universities who depend on international enrollment to budget their finances, International students  are directly affected by enrollment limits, housing availability, and access to support services. Domestic students are affected because they are also fighting for housing as well as support services. The Local community is also affected because, for those that do not own houses they are competing with students for housing and public services.

As of right now universities in Nova Scotia continue to enroll large numbers of international students although housing and campus capacity is limited. The government has introduced new policies to cap study permits, which signals their concern about the rapid growth of international enrollment across Canada. These actions suggest that the current approach may not be sustainable. This project examines enrollment patterns, tuition dependency and housing capacity to help the decision maker determine whether international enrollment should be adjusted to better balance finaces and overall student experience.
