# International-Enrollment-and-University-Sustainability
This repository contains information on international student enrollment and examines how housing limits and tuition reliance shape university sustainability.

Decision Statement: Should the Nova Scotia Minister of Advanced Education reduce international student enrollment at public universities due to housing shortatges and tuition dependency?

Decision Maker: Nova Scotia Minister of Advanced Education 

Executive Summary: 

Universities in Nova Scotia depend on international Students because they are a key source of tuition revenue. International enrollment has grown at a faster rate than domestic enrollment, which helps universities cover expenses. However, this growth has increased pressure on housing, student services, and acadmic capacity.

Many students struggle to find affordable housing, which can affect their well-being and ability to stay in university. Also, changes to immigration and study permit policies makes it harder to rely on international students. Which raises the question can these current enrollment levels be maintained?

This project helps the Nova Scotia Minister of Advanced Education decide if international student enrollment at public universities be adjusted. By examining enrollment trends, tuition dependency, and housing shortages.
